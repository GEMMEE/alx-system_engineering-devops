## Requirements

### General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All scripts should be exactly two lines long(`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
* All files should end with a new line ([why](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789))
* The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
* Not allowed to use backticks, `&&`, `||` or `;`
* All scripts must be executable(`chmod u+x file`)


## Tasks (_mandatory_)

**Write a script that**:

> **0-current\_working\_directory**

Prints the absolute path name of the current working directory.

> **1-listit**

Displays the contents list of your current directory.

> **2-bring\_me\_home**

Changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory.

> **3-listfiles**

Displays current directory contents in a long format

> **4-listmorefiles**

Displays current directory contents, including hidden files, in the long format.

> **5-listfilesdigitonly**

Displays current directory contents in long format with user and group IDs displayed numerically and with  hidden files

> **6-firstdirectory**

Creates a directory named `my_first_directory` in the `/tmp/` directory.

> **7-movethatfile**

Moves the file `betty` from `/tmp/` to `/tmp/my_first_directory`.

> **8-firstdelete**

Deletes the file `betty` found in `/tmp/my_first_direcory`

> **9-firstdirdeletion**

Deletes the directory `my_first_directory` that is in the `/temp` directory

> **10-back**

Changes the working directory to the previous one

> **11-lists**

Lists all files including hidden files in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format.

> **12-file_type**

Prints the type of the file named `iamafile` which will be in the `/tmp` directory when script is run.

> **13-symbolic_link**

Creates a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory.

> **14-copy_html**

Copies all the HTML files(files with `.html` extension) from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory.

## Advanced tasks (_optional_)

**Write a script that**:

> **100-lets_move**

Moves all files beginning with an uppercase letter to the directory `/tmp/u`.

> **101-clean_emacs**

Deletes all files in the current working directory that end with the character`~`.

> **102-tree**

Creates the directories `welcome/`, `welcome/to/` and `welcome/to/school` in the current directory. 

> **103-commas**

Lists all the files and directories of the current directory, separated by commas (,).
  * Directory names should end with a slash (/)
  * Files and directories starting with a dot (.) should be listed
  * The listing should be alpha ordered, except for the directories . and .. which should be listed at the very beginning
  * Only digits and letters are used to sort; Digits should come first
  * You can assume that all the files we will test with will have at least one letter or one digit
  * The listing should end with a new line
    ```
    gamachu@ubuntu:~/$ ls -a

    .  ..  0-commas  0-commas-checks  1-empty_casks  2-gifs  3-directories  4-zeros  5-rot13  6-odd  7-sort_rot13  Makefile  quote  .test  test_dir  test.var

    gamachu@ubuntu:~/$ ./103-commas

    ./, ../, 0-commas, 0-commas-checks/, 1-empty_casks, 2-gifs, 3-directories, 4-zeros, 5-rot13, 6-odd, 7-sort_rot13, Makefile, quote, .test, test_dir/, test.var

    gamachu@ubuntu:~/$

    ```


> **school.mgc**

Creates a magic file `school.mgc` that can be used with the command file to detect School data files. School data files always contain the string SCHOOL at offset 0.

* Tip: `man file` and see how to compile a magic file(`file -C [-m magicfiles]`)

    ```
    gamachu@ubuntu:/tmp/magic$ cp /bin/ls .
    gamachu@ubuntu:/tmp/magic$ ls -lav

    gamachu@ubuntu:/tmp/magic$ file --mime-type -m school.mgc *
    fake_school0: text/plain
    fake_school1: text/plain
    ls:           application/octet-stream
    school.mgc:   application/octet-stream
    true_school0: School
    true_school1: School
    gamachu@ubuntu:/tmp/magic$ file -m school.mgc *
    fake_school0: ASCII text
    fake_school1: ASCII text
    ls:           data
    school.mgc:   data
    true_school0: School data
    true_school1: School data
    gamachu@ubuntu:/tmp/magic$ cat fake_school0
    School, this is fake because
    School should have been 'SCHOOL'
    gamachu@ubuntu:/tmp/magic$ cat fake_school1
    SCHOOL this is the fake 1
    because offset is 1
    gamachu@ubuntu:/tmp/magic$ cat true_school0
    SCHOOL, the real school
    because offset is zero and the string is matched
    gamachu@ubuntu:/tmp/magic$ cat true_school1
    SCHOOL
    again the real one
    because the string is SCHOOL
    is matched and its offset is 0
    gamachu@ubuntu:/tmp/magic$

    ```
